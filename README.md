I've done the following steps:

## 1. Write HTML file.

- I've changed the HTML title.
- I've seperated my HTML file into "Header", "Navigation bar", "Main" with "Aside" and "Section" nested inside, as well as the "Footer".
- Link css reset and css stylesheet to the HTML.
- I found the font links from https://fonts.google.com/, and use the prepared code on the website to use them in my CSS.
- For links: I've linked "a" elements throughout the HTML file by using "id" attributes, and for external links, I've added the URLs or placeholders for future updates. I've also made clickable Email and Telephone number in my Contact list in the Footer.
- All images are linked to the right source file with an "alt" attributes for accessibility.

## 2. Download images I found from Pixabay.com and Google Images.

- I've downloaded some images I found online, save them into my assets/images folder.

## 3. Style HTML with CSS.

- I've used a reset.css file from our course materials, and added it into my css folder.
- I've created a style.css by using the touch command in the Terminal.
- Define variables for color palette. For the color palette, I've used a online tool to decide the color I want to use:
  https://www.csscolorpalettes.com/
- Seperate the CSS sections into: Global style, Header, Navigation bar, Main, Aside, Section and Footer.
  I've used several kinds of selectors: direct element selector, combined selector, class selector and id selector, pseudo selector, etc. to style the page.
- For display and layout, I've used flexbox in the Main, Aside, Section and Footer area, to make sure these elements are in the areas I want them to be and are fluid while changing viewports.
- For images, I need to edit and crop them in my Pictures App, then use them in my HTML.
- For images in the Section area, I've used the simple Float-right or left to achieve my design. I tried to use Grid or Flexbox at the beginning, then found out the simple float could do a better job, then I decided to use the simpler version.
- Media queries: this is my first time to figure out media queries by myself, I needed to decide the breakpoints. After many tries, I decided to use 768px and 500px as my breakpoints, as when I inspect my page, around 500px, my page layout is not ideal, so I have designed a style specifically for the cellphone viewport.
  In the 768px breakpoint, I've used Flexbox for the entire layout, but in the Section part, I've used a single column grid to achieve the simple but responsive design.

  In the 500px breakpoint, I noticed the original page design was a bit busy on the smaller screen, so I got rid of some paddings, margins borders, and removed decorative items that might seem odd in a smaller screen. The result is a simpler design but has the same feel as the original design.

## 3. Review my HTML and CSS files to make sure they meet the criteria. Check the HTML page in browswer to see whether it displays properly.

## 4. Leaving Comments

- While writing HTML and CSS, I've used commenting feature to seperate sections, try out different options by hide/unhide my code.
- When I'm happy with the design, finally, I've cleaned up my comments by only leaving the necessary ones for the reiewer.

## 5. Write the README.md, to summarize what I've done.

## 6. How I did my research.

- I did my research on w3schools, MDN web docs, CSS Tricks to understand some properties, values, selectors, flexbox, grid and media queries.
- I've also watched a couple of Youtube videos on Grid and Flexbox to get a deeper understanding.

## In conclusion:

I really enjoyed this homework, I was able to work on one area at a time and get a deeper dive in some of the key concepts in CSS, such as Flexbox, Grid and Media queries. BTW, it took me 2 days to figure out my Media query part without breaking my code or rewrite lots of the area. I didn't think I could be done before the deadline, but I've done it. The site has a simple design and I chose a cheerful color palette. I know I could've done a lot more, but for now, this site makes me super happy.
